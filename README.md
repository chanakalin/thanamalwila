# Thanamalwila #
**Thanamalwila** is an open sourced IoT based solution for monitoring and maintaining saturated none weather conditions for open field agriculture.

## Development story ##
This project started as an entry to [SLIoT Challenge](https://sliot.cse.mrt.ac.lk/) in 2017 under a different name ultimately able to achieve the runner up position in open category.

Since then with the years of experiences taken on R&D, trial and error as well as industry focuses on some key technologies, the project is in beta stage to be released to the public in near future.

## Name ##
**Thanamalwila** (or *Thanamalvila*) is a region in [Uva province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uva_Province), [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka) which is famous for the farmers (or warriors) who grow all organic, geneticallay not modified and chemically not processed cannabis (or simply what we called as ["Ganja"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganja) ) for the use of endogenous medicine and for the people who want's to get high with an all natural substance while fighting with laws implemented by the [British colonial rulers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Ceylon) which are still exists today.

While we believe (and scientifically proven) over usage of cannabis can be harmful, but it should be grown organically always and should be publicly available after educating users on usage, limits and side effects.

Therefore we are dedicating this solution in the name of open field "Ganja farmers" *( we can called them as warriors)* in **Thanamalwila** region who are risking there life in-front of the low enforcement.
